An app for tenants

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- you can install the apk directly, in the release section
- you can create account, view your account on account page, log in and out, and forget your password.
- the other functionalities are yet to be implemented


For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
